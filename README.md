# ðŸ‘‹ Hey

Welcome to this project.
This is a repository of mine from a personal project. It's simple, very simple, so don't expect to much.
You type something in, it saves the value into Firebase, goes to the handle file, generates a value out of it, and adds everything together.

Have fun messing around with the files.

App build with `create-react-app`
